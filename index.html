        <h2 class="button">BECOMING A SOFTWARE ENGINEER</h2>
        <p>Software engineers are the unsung heroes of the digital sector. It’s thanks to their skills
            (and, of course, the wonders of modern engineering) that our devices can transcend their plastic 
            and silicon exteriors to become the invaluable tools we use today.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>From afar, the work these coders do can seem daunting, even incomprehensible. But thanks to the expansion
            of computer science education and training options, it has never been easier to enter the software engineering
              field — even with little to no prior industry experience. All it takes is a healthy level of ambition,
               hard work, foresight, and adaptability.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><strong>Becoming a software engineer typically encompasses six key steps:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            <li>choosing a learning cohort and path </li>
            <li>Obtaining an education on respectech campus</li>
            <li>Gaining experience with real projects </li>
            <li>Getting certified after torough works done </li>
            <li>Building your portfolio</li>
            <li>Applying for jobs</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While the upskilling process requires strong commitment and patience, the career rewards it provides are 
            well worth the effort. Read on to learn how to become a software engineer!</p>

   of pros and cons, so consider them carefully before enrolling in an academic course!</p>
    
    
    
    
    
    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Gaining Experience</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>Your skills training shouldn’t start and end with formal classes! Aspiring software engineers will want to accrue hands-on experience through volunteer work, personal projects, internships, and other practical work opportunities. Practicing your coding skills outside of the classroom will allow you to pad out your resume, add items to your professional portfolio, and otherwise improve your standing during the job search.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>Not sure where to start? If you’re attending a college program or bootcamp, you may want to reach out to your institution’s alumni affairs office to see if they can connect you with any open internship or placement opportunities. Alternatively, you can check out a few of the resources below for inspiration!</p>

    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What Programming Languages Should You Focus on to Become a Software Engineer?&nbsp;</h2>
    
    
 
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Python</h3>
    
    
    
    <p>Python is another common language used primarily for back end development and data science. This general-purpose language is tailored to several different programming styles — such as object-oriented and functional — to aid in a variety of projects. Like JavaScript, Python is known for being&nbsp;<a href="https://bootcamp.cvn.columbia.edu/blog/python-basics-guide/">relatively easy to learn</a>, but even seasoned software engineers should consider its offerings; over&nbsp;<a href="https://info.hackerrank.com/rs/487-WAY-049/images/HackerRank-2020-Developer-Skills-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">50 percent of hiring managers (PDF, 2.8 MB)</a>&nbsp;now seek candidates fluent in the language.&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Go&nbsp;</h3>
    
    
    
    <p>Google-developed Go has seen a steady increase in popularity since its 2009 inception. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://info.hackerrank.com/rs/487-WAY-049/images/HackerRank-2020-Developer-Skills-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">analysts at HackerRank (PDF, 2.8 MB)</a>, it has been “the #1 language developers want to learn next” for three consecutive years; it was also found to be the “12th most known language for 2020.” Given the age of many of its prominent competitors, it is safe to assume Go will only continue to carve a deeper niche in the broad programming spectrum, making it a valuable language for today’s engineers.&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">Java</h3>
    
    
    
    <p>Java is the&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fifth-most commonly used language</a>&nbsp;among professional developers. As a general-use and object-oriented language, Java is especially valuable for developers creating objects that “encompass functions and data.” The language’s versatility, paired with its consistent demand among all notable languages, keeps its appeal timeless.&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    
    <h3 class="wp-block-heading">HTML</h3>
    
    
    
    <p>Despite its potentially intimidating name, “HyperText Markup Language” (HTML) is a highly accessible language often used to describe a web page’s formatting and overall appearance. As a markup language, HTML is more specific in its usability, but remains&nbsp;<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the most commonly used languages</a>&nbsp;worldwide.&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    
    <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Software Developer Salaries &amp; Job Outlook — In New York &amp; the U.S.</h2>
    
    
    
    <p>Though pandemic-related impacts continue to be felt within the U.S. economy, recent BLS data predicts&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm#tab-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continued growth in the software engineering industry from 2019 to 2029</a>; this is comparatively much faster than the average for all other occupations. In May 2019, software developers were found to make&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151256.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">average annual wage of $111,620</a>. However, this figure often varies by location. In New York, for instance,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_ny.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mean wage was found to be $119,570</a>&nbsp;— a rate significantly higher than the national average.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>That said, remote work trends have reshaped parts of the software developer employment process, with many candidates narrowing their job search to opportunities that offer remote functionality. In turn, employers have been forced to consolidate and restructure significant aspects of their infrastructure to emphasize remote working.&nbsp;</p>
    
    
    
    <p>This trend has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3604054/software-developer-jobs-outlook-for-2021.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenced but ultimately not hindered the availability of engineering jobs</a>, though it remains to be seen how the pandemic will impact long-term industry salary figures; for now, they are generally stable following a period of constant growth from 2016–2020. Keep in mind that salary is affected by a number of factors including professional experience, educational background, company size, and knowledge of in-demand skills and technologies.</p>
